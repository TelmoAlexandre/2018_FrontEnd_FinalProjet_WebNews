The former NSO developer is believed to have stolen the code after learning he was going to be sacked. Israel's Justice Ministry said if the sale had gone ahead it could have harmed state security. In a statement, the ministry said the accused was a senior programmer at NSO who had access to the firm's development systems including its stores of source code. The ministry said once the programmer had downloaded company code, he posed as a hacker and sought to sell the software on dark web markets. It is claimed that he asked for a payment of $50m to be made in crypto-cash to make it harder to trace. The unidentified individual who agreed to buy the software contacted NSO before the deal went ahead. A sting was set up and the suspected thief was arrested. Daily newspaper Israel Hayom reported that the indictment against the former NSO employee said: \"The defendant's ‎actions seriously jeopardised the NSO Group and ‎could have led to its collapse.\". The programmer has been charged with theft, intent to compromise national security, pursuing an unlicensed defence transaction and disruption of a computer system. A statement released by the defendant's legal team said its client \"never tried to undermine national security\". <br/><br/>They added: ‎\"We believe the court will get to the truth in this ‎case. We will prove these allegations to be ‎disproportionate and baseless.\" NSO ‎Group came to prominence in 2016 after being accused of creating software that can overcome security protections on Apple iPhones. NSO software has also been implicated in a long-running spyware scandal in Mexico. In response, NSO has said it only sells to authorised agencies and has no control over the way its tools are used.",

                    Description="Marine wildlife could benefit if some de-commissioned oil rigs were left on the sea bed, a survey says.",
                    Content="This challenges the conventional wisdom that the sea bed should be restored to its pristine state when a rig's life ends. The paper says over the 30-year lifetime of an oil rig, creatures have often colonised the structure to form a reef. It says this artificial habitat can be more valuable than the original seabed. It can also protect sea creatures from fishing. <br/><br/>The paper from the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia, is based on a survey of 40 experts from academia, government and consultancies. Their focus was on the North Sea - but the authors say the principles are applicable anywhere. More than 90% of the experts surveyed said governments should abandon the principle that oil rigs should always be removed. Instead, there should be a more flexible, case-by-case approach to de-commissioning. <br/><br/>It warns that the process of removing the rigs can be damaging to the environment in its own right. One of the partners in the new report was North Sea Futures, run by an environment consultant, Anna-Mette Jorgensen. She told BBC News: \"Current policy is very unlikely to be good for the environment or the taxpayer. The ecosystem has adapted to these structures. There are lots of fish round them - and they are one of very few areas protected from fisheries.\" She said the endangered lophelia cold water coral in the North Sea appeared to be using the rigs to colonise new areas.",

                    Content="They say the local smelting industry produces 1% of all the sulphur dioxide (SO₂) going into the air globally, something close to two million tonnes a year. SO2 is particularly unpleasant if breathed in; but it also washes out of the sky as \"acid rain\", damaging plant-life and denuding the quality of water in streams and rivers. The extent of Norilsk's pollution problem is captured in remarkable new maps from Europe's Sentinel-5P satellite. The spacecraft was put up last year to track the gases responsible for dirty air - with SO₂ being one of the prime culprits. <br/><br/>Assembled in the UK and carrying the Dutch-led Tropomi instrument, S5P promises to be a game-changer in monitoring what's happening in our atmosphere. It has much higher resolution than its predecessors and acquires data on such a scale that its maps can be assembled very quickly. \"What's very interesting about the Norilsk data is that they show you the different transport pathways,\" explained Dr Nicolas Theys from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB). \"You can see how the emissions follow the topography, moving around the mountains. People could use this information to better assess the environmental impact in this region.\"",

The Environment Agency said the unidentified substance has now \"sufficiently diluted\" and is no longer \"causing any issues\". <br/><br/>One Buckingham resident described it as like a \"washing machine has exploded\". Agency officers have provided the casualty figure, but believe the number of dead fish could be higher as the \"pollution has severely impacted the river's ecosystem\". They said it may take \"years\" for the river to recover. <br/><br/>The Environment Agency is investigating the incident, and a spokesman said they were waiting for sample results to confirm the pollutants, which may contain detergents. He said: \"We believe that the pollutant has now passed through Stony Stratford and into Milton Keynes with no immediate adverse impacts on aquatic life past Thornton, Buckinghamshire.\" They do not believe there is a risk to humans or animals, but as a precaution are asking people to stay out of the river and keep pets and livestock away from the stretch between Brackley and Milton Keynes until the investigation is complete. <br/><br/>Anglers are also being asked not to fish in the polluted areas. After Buckingham, the 140 mile (230km) long river flows through Milton Keynes, Bedford, St Neots, Huntingdon, St Ives, Ely and The Fens before entering The Wash at King's Lynn. ",

                    Description="A family in France has become the first in the world to move into a 3D-printed house. The four-bedroom property is a prototype for bigger projects aiming to make housebuilding quicker and cheaper. Could it cause a shift in the building industry?",
                    Content="With curved walls designed to reduce the effects of humidity and digital controls for disabled people, this house could be an expensive realisation of an architect's vision. But having taken 54 hours to print - with four more months for contractors to add in things such as windows, doors and the roof - its cost of around £176,000 to build makes it 20% cheaper than an identical construction using more traditional solutions. The team now believe they could print the same house again in only 33 hours. The 95m (1022ft) square house - built for a family of five with four bedrooms and a big central space in Nantes - is a collaboration between the city council, a housing association and University of Nantes. <br/><br/>Francky Trichet, the council's lead on technology and innovation, says the purpose of the project was to see whether this type of construction could become mainstream for housing, and whether its principles could be applied to other communal buildings, such as sports halls. He believes the process will disrupt the construction industry. \"For 2,000 years there hasn't been a change in the paradigm of the construction process. We wanted to sweep this whole construction process away,\" he says. \"That's why I'm saying that we're at the start of a story. We've just written, 'Once upon a time'.\" <br/><br/>Now, he says, their work will \"force\" private companies to \"take the pen\" and continue the narrative. The house has been built in a deprived neighbourhood in the north of the town and was partly funded by the council. Nordine and Nouria Ramdani, along with their three children, were the lucky ones chosen to live there. <br/><br/>\"It's a big honour to be a part of this project,\" says Nordine. \"We lived in a block of council flats from the 60s, so it's a big change for us. \"It's really something amazing to be able to live in a place where there is a garden, and to have a detached house.\" <br/><br/>The house is designed in a studio by a team of architects and scientists, then programmed into a 3D printer. The printer is then brought to the site of the home. It works by printing in layers from the floor upwards. Each wall consists of two layers of the insulator polyurethane, with a space in-between which is filled with cement. <br/><br/>This creates a thick, insulated, fully-durable wall. The windows, doors, and roof are then fitted. And, voila, you have a home. The house was the brainchild of Benoit Furet, who heads up the project at University of Nantes. He thinks that in five years they will reduce the cost of the construction of such houses by 25% while adhering to building regulations, and by 40% in 10 to 15 years. This is partly because of the technology becoming more refined and cheaper to develop and partly because of economies of scale as more houses are built. Printing, he adds, also allows architects to be far more creative with the shapes of the houses they are building. For example, the house in Nantes was built to curve around the 100-year-old protected trees on the plot.",

It said the vehicles would initially be put to commercial use within Chinese cities but added it was also targeting foreign markets. The company is one of several competing to sell \"level-4 autonomy\" buses. The classification - set by the transport engineering body SAE International - refers to highly automated driving systems that can cope with most driving conditions, even if a human fails to respond appropriately to a request to intervene. <br/><br/>It is one step below the maximum level-5 tier, which extends to all driving scenarios, including dirt roads and unusual weather conditions. Baidu's chief executive, Robin Li, detailed its plans at the company's annual artificial intelligence developer conference in Beijing. He said: \"2018 marks the first year of commercialisation for autonomous driving. \"In the past, China exported cheap commodities to the world. In the future, China will export AI technology to the world.\" The Apolong bus can seat up to 14 people, and has been developed with a local vehicle manufacturer. <br/><br/>It has no driver's seat, steering wheel or pedals. It runs on electric power and can travel up to 100km (62 miles) after a two-hour charge, at up to 70km/h. Baidu envisages it being used for \"last-mile\" drop-offs within enclosed areas, such as airports and tourist sites.

Her \"urban mine\" at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is extracting these materials not from rock, but from electronic gadgets. The Sydney-based expert in materials science reckons her operation will become efficient enough to be making a profit within a couple of years. <br/><br/>\"Economic modelling shows the cost of around $500,000 Australian dollars (£280,000) for a micro-factory pays off in two to three years, and can generate revenue and create jobs,\" she says. \"That means there are environmental, social and economic benefits.\" In fact, research indicates that such facilities can actually be far more profitable than traditional mining. <br/><br/>According to a study published recently in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, a typical cathode-ray tube TV contains about 450g of copper and 227g of aluminium, as well as around 5.6g of gold. While a gold mine can generate five or six grammes of the metal per tonne of raw material, that figure rises to as much as 350g per tonne when the source is discarded electronics. The figures emerged in a joint study from Beijing's Tsinghua University and Macquarie University, in Sydney, where academics examined data from eight recycling companies in China to work out the cost for extracting these metals from electronic waste. <br/><br/>Expenses included the costs of waste collection, labour, energy, material and transportation, as well as capital costs for the recyclers' equipment and buildings. And when these costs - and the effects of Chinese government subsidies for recycling - were taken into account, the team found that mining from ore was 13 times more expensive than e-waste mining.",
